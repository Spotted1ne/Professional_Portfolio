## 📂 Project 1: Global Revenue Risk Audit (Python)
**Goal:** Identify revenue concentration risks across international markets to inform Q4 strategy.
* **Technique:** Utilized **Pandas** for data reconciliation and **Matplotlib** for visualization.
* **Key Insight:** Identified a critical **60% revenue dependency** on international markets, flagging a major vulnerability in the current sales portfolio.
